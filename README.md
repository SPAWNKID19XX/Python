# QA and QA-Python
Hi, my name is Boris, I am a student
Here I will show my evolution in Quality Assurance(Test Case, Check List, Bug Report) and after Automatization tests using Python, but befor automatization testing I should studies a Python, because I do not have any experience with this language. And then I will have firsts steps on Python.
The bigest part of files is a exercise from "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python".I like how a author explains, after each of teams I should solve some exersizes form author, and a book does not have a solutionas. so, it is really my solutions of  problems.
